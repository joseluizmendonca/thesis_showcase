  abstract = {The evolution of fuel injection systems has significantly impacted the efficiency, performance, and environmental impact of internal combustion engines. This Study aims to compare two prominent fuel injection technologies: Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) and traditional Fuel Injection (FI). By examining their working principles, benefits, drawbacks, and impact on engine performance, this study provides a comprehensive analysis to determine which system is better suited for modern automotive applications. Fuel Injection systems have replaced carburetors as the primary method of delivering fuel to internal combustion engines. This advancement has resulted in improved fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and enhanced engine performance. Two prominent fuel injection technologies are Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) and traditional Fuel Injection (FI). This study compares and contrasts these two systems to determine their relative advantages and disadvantages. Fuel Injection Systems In a traditional fuel injection system, fuel is injected into the intake manifold or intake port before it reaches the combustion chamber. The fuel is mixed with the incoming air, forming a homogeneous mixture that is then combusted.},

  abstract = {Recent increases in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards have led to widespread adoption of vehicles equipped with gasoline direct-injection (GDI) engines. Changes in engine technologies can alter emissions. To quantify these effects, we measured gas- and particle-phase emissions from 82 light-duty gasoline vehicles recruited from the California in-use fleet tested on a chassis dynamometer using the cold-start unified cycle. The fleet included 15 GDI vehicles, including 8 GDIs certified to the most-stringent emissions standard, superultra-low-emission vehicles (SULEV). We quantified the effects of engine technology, emission certification standards, and cold-start on emissions. For vehicles certified to the same emissions standard, there is no statistical difference of regulated gas-phase pollutant emissions between PFIs and GDIs. However, GDIs had, on average, a factor of 2 higher particulate matter (PM) mass emissions than PFIs due to higher elemental carbon (EC) emissions. SULEV certified GDIs have a factor of 2 lower PM mass emissions than GDIs certified as ultralow-emission vehicles (3.0 {\textpm} 1.1 versus 6.3 {\textpm} 1.1 mg/mi), suggesting improvements in engine design and calibration. Comprehensive organic speciation revealed no statistically significant differences in the composition of the volatile organic compounds emissions between PFI and GDIs, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX). Therefore, the secondary organic aerosol and ozone formation potential of the exhaust does not depend on engine technology. Cold-start contributes a larger fraction of the total unified cycle emissions for vehicles meeting more-stringent emission standards. Organic gas emissions were the most sensitive to cold-start compared to the other pollutants tested here. There were no statistically significant differences in the effects of cold-start on GDIs and PFIs. For our test fleet, the measured 14.5\% decrease in CO2 emissions from GDIs was much greater than the potential climate forcing associated with higher black carbon emissions. Thus, switching from PFI to GDI vehicles will likely lead to a reduction in net global warming.}

However, the availability of resources for the sustainable use of these alternative fuels, the possible risks, and their fate at the end of their life are frequently questioned, necessitating a detailed assessment of factors influencing the use of all three alternative fuels for vehicular use. Though the vehicles powered by batteries and fuel cells are ``locally'' zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), they have resource scarcity, infrastructure limitations and are relatively expensive, thus restricting their market penetration and consumer acceptance. Biofuels, though can be used in the existing vehicles, procuring the required amounts of feedstock, and mitigating food-versus-fuel issues is still a challenge. Overcoming these challenges is a crucial and critical step for the sustained use of these alternative fuels as primary vehicular fuels. To accomplish this, all these challenges need to be categorized and a comparative analysis among them is necessary to address them. This work can therefore serve as a ready reference for researchers and policy makers to take appropriate and informed decisions for long-term action to achieve the goals of the Paris agreement to reduce global temperature.},

A chapter on 'Intermittency' has been added and chapters revised to reflect the latest policy developments. //  Concawe and Aramco have jointly commissioned this study, aiming to conduct a techno-environmental (Part 1) and economic (Part 2) analysis of different e-fuels pathways produced in different regions of the world (North, Centre, and South of Europe, as well as Middle East and North Africa) in 2020, 2030 and 2050, with assessments of sensitivities to multiple key techno-economic parameters. The e-fuels pathways included in the scope of this study are: e-hydrogen (liquefied and compressed), e-methane (liquefied and compressed), e-methanol, e-OME), e-methanol to gasoline, e-methanol to kerosene, e-ammonia, and e-Fischer-Tropsch kerosene/diesel (low temperature reaction). The e-hydrogen is considered a final fuel but also as a feedstock for producing other e-fuels. The study also includes: - An assessment of stand-alone units versus e-plants integrated with oil refineries - A comparison of e-fuels production costs versus fossil fuels / biofuels / e-fuels produced from nuclear electricity, - An assessment of the impact of intermittency and seasonality of renewable energy supply on storage requirements, synthesis plant sizing and production costs, - An analysis of the context of e-fuels in the future in Europe (potential demand, CAPEX, renewable electricity potential, land requirement, feedstocks requirements) - A deep dive into the safety and environmental considerations, societal acceptance, barriers to deployment and regulation The e-fuels techno-environmental assessment (Part 1) has been developed by Concawe and Aramco, and the e-fuels economical and context assessment (Part 2) has been conducted by the consultants LBST and E4tech, under the supervision of Concawe and Aramco. For the base cases, it is assumed that the e-fuel plant produces 1 million t of e-diesel equivalent per year. Hence, the nameplate capacities of hydrogen generation via water electrolysis and downstream processes depends on the characteristics of regional renewable electricity supply.}

Higher penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources implies the installation of energy storage, to store electricity excess and enhanced system efficiency. These electricity surpluses that will occur more often in the future energy system could be effectively utilized for the production of alternative fuels. Most of the alternative fuels that are considered for future applications are already known chemicals or products, nowadays used for other purposes. Another great advantage of some alternative fuels lies in their possibilities to act as an energy carrier. This feature might be crucial while discussing their utilisation potential and further development. Fuels which can simultaneously be used for power generation and as an energy carrier will have a more important role in the future and are likely to be utilized on a greater scale. Renewable energy source like biomass, on the other hand, is already widely used, and their role in the future system is not questionable. Even though significant increment in biomass consumption raises serious concerns about its sustainability, and seeks for new approaches. In this work, the authors tried to review alternative fuel characteristics, alongside their utilisation and production opportunities. To come up with the optimal solutions, the authors compared various proposed alternative fuels, alongside their advantages and drawbacks with an aim to find the most appropriate role for each fuel.},

This method relies on comparison of the electric current-related values of the examined injector with the model characteristics, which are representing the properly functioning injector. A model of the fuel injector in the form of the electric current waveform that describes the changes in the electric current and voltage during its work is presented in this article. Complex equations describing the fuel injector model under discussion account for the characteristics of the current variations, with no damage-induced modifications. Due to these, the modeled electric current/voltage waveform mirrors the real conditions. The use of a mathematical model describing the voltage--current phenomena occurring during the injector operation allows determining the actual beginning and duration of the injection. The model can also be used to develop new injector diagnostic methods that can be implemented in the engine controller (ECU).},

  abstract = {For methanol/diesel dual-fuel combustion, there are two different methanol injection implementations: port injection into the intake manifold and direct injection into cylinder. In this work, an experimental comparison was conducted for the two methanol injection strategies to study the effects of the methanol-energy-substation ratio (ESR) and diesel injection timing on the fuel-air mixing and combustion characteristics. The results showed that the ignition delay was increased with ESR due to the cooling effect of methanol evaporation in the cylinder. The combustion duration under methanol direct injection condition was much shorter than that of the methanol port injection strategy. The methanol direct injection strategy had a more controllable and stable heat release than that of methanol port injection strategy. The maximum ESR could reach up to 96.0},

The methanol direct injection strategy had a more controllable and stable heat release than that of methanol port injection strategy. The maximum ESR could reach up to 96.0\% in the methanol direct injection strategy. The methanol direct injection strategy had a better fuel economy, and its maximum indicated thermal efficiency could reach up to 41.55\% at 50\% ESR. The methanol direct injection strategy yielded higher NOx emissions than that with the port injection strategy, accompanied by a mild increase of soot emissions. Compared with methanol port injection, the methanol direct injection strategy exhibits lower CO emissions, however, it suffers from higher HC emissions.},
